# BioenergeticFoodwebs.jl

This package provides tools to simulate foodweb dynamics and quantify the stability of these
foodwebs with various metrics, using `julia`. It was thought to generate foodwebs with
realistic structures and parameters by default, however, each model parameter can be easily
customized if wanted.

*Complete the package description and explain in more detail the package features and the
package "philosophy" here.*

    Work in progress.

# Tests

Example doctests:

```jldoctest
a = 5
b = 8
a + b

# output

13
```

```jldoctest
julia> a = 5
5
julia> b = 8
8
julia> a + b
13
```
