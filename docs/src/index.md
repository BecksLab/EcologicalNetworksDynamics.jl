    ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

This package provides tools to easily simulate ecological network dynamics using Julia.
These networks can either trophic interactions only (i.e. food webs),
or trophic interactions plus various non-trophic interactions (i.e. multiplex networks).
We provide functions to generate food webs structure from well-known model
(e.g. niche model).
Default community parameters are taken from the literature,
but can also be easily customized if wanted.

## How can I contribute?

The easiest way to contribute is to [open an issue](https://github.com/BecksLab/BEFWM2/issues)
if you spot a bug, a typo or can't manage to do something.
Another way is to fork the repository,
start working from the `develop` branch,
and when ready, submit a pull request.
