    ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

This package provides tools to simulate foodweb dynamics
and quantify the stability of these foodwebs with various metrics, using Julia.
It has been designed to generate foodwebs
with realistic structures and parameters by default.
However each model parameter can be easily customized if wanted.
