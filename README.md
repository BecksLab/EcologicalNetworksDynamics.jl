EcologicalNetworksDynamics is a Julia package that simulates species biomass dynamics
in ecological networks.
EcologicalNetworksDynamics makes things easy for beginners
while remaining flexible for adventurous or experienced users
who would like to tweak the model.

## Before you start

Before anything else, to use EcologicalNetworksDynamics you have to install Julia.
For that go to the [official download page](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
Once you have successfully installed Julia,
you can install the library by running from a Julia REPL:

```julia
using Pkg

# /!\ The following will not work until the package has been
# published to the official Julia registry.
# Pkg.add("EcologicalNetworksDynamics")

# In the meantime, use the following instead:
Pkg.add(url="git@github.com:BecksLab/EcologicalNetworksDynamics.jl.git")
```
[registry]: https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General

To check that the package installation went well,
create a simple food web with:

```julia
using EcologicalNetworkDynamics
Foodweb([1 => 2]) # Species 1 eats species 2.
```

## Learning EcologicalNetworkDynamics

The [Quick start] page shows
how to simulate biomass dynamics in a simple food web.
The rest of the [Guide] provides a step by step introduction
to the package features,
from the generation of the network structure
to the simulation of the biomass dynamics.
At each step, we detail how the model can be customized at your will.
Lastly, the [Tutorials] section
contains realistic use-cases of EcologicalNetworksDynamics.
