richness(solution::Solution; threshold = 0)

Return the number of alive species at each timestep of the simulation.
`solution` is the output of [`simulate`](@ref).
By default, species are considered extinct if their biomass is 0.
But, this `threshold` can be changed using the corresponding keyword argument.

# Examples

Let's start with a simple example where the richness remains constant:

```jldoctest
julia> foodweb = Foodweb([0 0; 1 0])
       m = default_model(foodweb)
       B0 = [0.5, 0.5]
       sol = simulate(m, B0)
       richness_trajectory = richness(sol)
       all(richness_trajectory .== 2) # At each timestep, there are 2 alive species.
true
```

Now let's assume that the producer is extinct at the beginning of the simulation,
while its consumer is not.
We expect to observe a decrease in richness from 1 to 0 over time.

```jldoctest
julia> B0 = [0, 0.5] # The producer is extinct at the beginning.
       sol = simulate(m, B0)
       richness_trajectory = richness(sol)
       richness_trajectory[1] == 1 && richness_trajectory[end] == 0
true
```

richness(solution::AbstractODESolution; threshold = 0) = richness.(solution.u; threshold)

"""
    richness(vec::AbstractVector; threshold = 0)

Return the number of alive species given a biomass vector `vec`.
By default, species are considered extinct if their biomass is 0.
But, this `threshold` can be changed using the corresponding keyword argument.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> foodweb = Foodweb([0 0; 1 0])
       m = default_model(foodweb)
       B0 = [0.5, 0.5]
       sol = simulate(m, B0)

       foodweb = Foodweb(:niche; S = 20, C = 0.1)

    total_biomass(solution::AbstractODESolution)

Total biomass of a community at each timestep of the simulation.
`solution` is the output of [`simulate`](@ref).

# Example

Let's consider a consumer feeding on a producer,
and let's start the simulation with the producer extinction
so we can observe the consumer's biomass decrease over time.

"""
    shannon_diversity(solution::AbstractODESolution; threshold = 0)

Shannon diversity index at each timestep of the simulation.
`solution` is the output of [`simulate`](@ref).
Shannon diversity is a measure of species diversity based on the entropy.
According to the Shannon index, for a same number of species,
the more evenly the biomass is distributed among them,
the higher the diversity.

# Example

We start a simple simulation with even biomass distribution,
therefore we expect the Shannon diversity to decrease over time
as the biomass of the species diverge from each other.

```jldoctest
julia> foodweb = Foodweb([0 0; 1 0])
       m = default_model(foodweb)
       B0 = [0.5, 0.5] # Even biomass, maximal shannon diversity.
       sol = simulate(m, B0)
       shannon_trajectory = shannon_diversity(sol)
       biomass_trajectory[1] > biomass_trajectory[end]

Shannon diversitty index given a biomass vector `vec
Shannon diversity is a measure of species diversity based on the entropy.
According to the Shannon index, for a same number of species,
the more evenly the biomass is distributed among them,
the higher the diversity.

# Example

We consider a simple example with 3 species, but different shannon diversity.

```jldoctest
julia> s1 = shannon_diversity([1, 1, 1])
       s2 = shannon_diversity([1, 1, 0.1])
       s3 = shannon_diversity([1, 1, 0.01])
       s1 > s2 > s3
true
```

We observe as we decrease the biomass of the third species,
the shannon diversity tends to 2, as we tend towards an effective two-species community.
