# Foodweb aka. "Trophic layer",
# is special because it does structure the whole network
# in a way that makes it a dependency
# of numerous other biorates and interaction layers.
# Typically, many default values are calculated from this layer,
# and values checks are performed against this layer.

"""
The Foodweb component, aka. "Trophic layer",
adds a set of trophic links connecting species in the model.
This is one of the most structuring components.

# Blueprint Creation from Raw Links.

From an adjacency list:
```jldoctest
julia> fw = Foodweb([:a => :b, :b => [:c, :d]])
blueprint for Foodweb with 2 trophic links:
  A:
  :a eats :b
  :b eats :c and :d

julia> Model(fw) # Automatically brings a 'Species' component.
Model with 2 components:
  - Species: 4 (:a, :b, :c, :d)
  - Foodweb: 3 links

julia> Model(Foodweb([4 => [2, 1], 2 => 1])) #  From species indices.
Model with 2 components:
  - Species: 4 (:s1, :s2, :s3, :s4)
  - Foodweb: 3 links
```

From a matrix:
```jldoctest
julia> fw = Foodweb([0 0 1; 1 0 1; 0 0 0])
blueprint for Foodweb with 3 trophic links:
  A: 3×3 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 3 stored entries:
 ⋅  ⋅  1
 1  ⋅  1
 ⋅  ⋅

julia> Model(fw)
Model with 2 components:
  - Species: 3 (:s1, :s2, :s3)
  - Foodweb: 3 links
```

# Blueprint Creation from Random Models.

__Cascade__ model: specify the desired number of species `S` and connectance `C`.
```jldoctest
julia> using Random
       Random.seed!(12)
       fw = Foodweb(:cascade, S = 5, C = 0.2)
blueprint for Foodweb with 5 trophic links:
  A: 5×5 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 5 stored entries:
 ⋅  1  ⋅  1  1
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  1  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  1
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
```

Random foodwebs are drawn until the desired connectance is obtained,
within a tolerance level defaulted to `tol_C = 0.1 * C`,
modifiable as a keyword argument.

__Niche__ model: either specify the connectance `C` or number of links `L`.
```jldoctest
julia> fw = Foodweb(:niche, S = 5, C = 0.2) #  From connectance.
blueprint for Foodweb with 5 trophic links:
  A: 5×5 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 5 stored entries:
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 1  1  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  1  ⋅  ⋅
 1  1  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅

julia> fw = Foodweb(:niche, S = 5, L = 4) #  From number of links.
blueprint for Foodweb with 4 trophic links:
  A: 5×5 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 4 stored entries:
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 1  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 1  1  1  ⋅  ⋅
```

The default tolerance levels for the niche model
are `tol_C = 0.1 * C` and `tol_L = 0.1 * L`,
modifiable as keyword arguments.

For either random model, the following keyword arguments can also be specified:
- `reject_cycles = false` (default): raise to forbid trophic cycles.
- `reject_if_disconnected = true` (default): lower to allow disconnected trophic networks.
- `max_iterations = 10^5` (default): give up if no satisfying network can be found
                                     after this number of random trials.

# Properties.

A model `m` with a `Foodweb` has the following properties.

- `m.A` or `m.trophic_links`: a view into the matrix of trophic links.
- `m.n_trophic_links`: the number of trophic links in the model.
- `m.trophic_levels`: calculate the trophic level of every species in the model.

- Distinguishing between `producers` (species without outgoing trophic links)
  and `consumers` (species with outgoing trophic links):
  - `m.{producers,consumers}_mask`: a boolean vector to select either kind of species.
  - `m.n_{producers,consumers}`: count number of species of either kind.
  - `is_{producer,consumer}(m, i)`: check whether species `i` (name or index) is of either kind.
  - `m.{producers,consumer}_indices`: iterate over either species kind indices.
  - `m.{producers,consumer}_{sparse,dense}_index`: obtain a
    \$species\\_name \\mapsto species\\_index\$ mapping:
    - the `sparse` index yields indices valid within the whole collection of species.
    - the `dense` index yields indices only valid within the restricted collection
      of species of either kind.

- Distinguishing betwen `preys` (species with incoming trophic links)
  and `tops` predators (species without incoming trophic links) works the same way.

- `m.producers_links`: boolean matrix highlighting potential links between producers.

- `m.herbivorous_links`: highlight only consumer-to-producer trophic links.
- `m.carnivorous_links`: highlight only consumer-to-consumer trophic links.
