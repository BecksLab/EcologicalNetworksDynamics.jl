# This legacy module is still what makes the whole program run.
# It needs to undergo some *very* deep refactoring before new features are added.
# And details of it are abstracted away through the outer System/Component interface.

EcologicalNetworksDynamics

Provide tools to simulate biomass dynamics in trophic and multiplex networks.
Trophic networks only include feeding interactions,
while multiplex networks also include non-trophic interactions such as
interference between predators, or plant facilitation.
The basic workflow has been designed to be as simple as possible,
while remaining flexible for the experienced or adventurous user
who would like to refine the model and its parameters.

Example of a simple workflow:

```julia
trophic_backbone = FoodWeb([1 => [2, 3]]) # species 1 eats plants 2 and 3
multi_net = MultiplexNetwork(trophic_backbone; L_facilitation = 1) # add 1 facilitation link
p = ModelParameters(multi_net) # generate model parameters
sol = simulate(p, rand(3)) # run simulation with random initial conditions
```

For more information, either go through the online documentation at (https://doc-url)
or if you are looking for the help of a specific function read its docstring
by writing `?<function_name>` in a Julia REPL.
