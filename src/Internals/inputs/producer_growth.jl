Create the parameters for the logistic producer growth model.
In the end, the `LogisticGrowth` struct created stores a vector of carrying capacities `K`
and a competition matrix between the producers `a`.

The carrying capacities can be specified via the `K` arguments,
by default they are all set to 1 for the producers and to `nothing` for the consumers.

By default the competition matrix `a` is assumed to have diagonal elements equal to 1
and 0 for all off-diagonal elements.
This default can be changed via the `a` argument.
You can either directly pass the interaction matrix,
a single `Number` that will be interpreted as the value of all diagonal elements,
a tuple of `Number` the first will be interpreted as the diagonal value and
the second as the off-diagonal values, or a named tuple of `Number`.
For the latter, the following aliases can be used to refer to the diagonal elements
'diagonal', 'diag', 'd', and for the off-diagonal elements 'offdiagonal', 'offdiag',
'o', 'rest', 'nondiagonal', 'nond'.
