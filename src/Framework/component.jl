# Components are not values, but they are reified here as julia *types*
# whose instances are the blueprints required to construct them.
#
# No concrete component type can be added twice to the system.
#
# When user wants to add a component to the system,
# they provide a blueprint value which needs to be expanded into a component.
#
# The data inside the blueprint is only useful to run the internal `expand!()` method once,
# and must not lend caller references to the system,
# so its internal state cannot be broken later.
# For now, this is enforced by requiring that all blueprints be copy-able.
# Only a copy of the caller blueprint is actually used for component expansion.
#
# This also permits that the whole system forks,
# including its own history of components as a collection of the blueprints used.
#
# Components require other components:
#
#   - Either because the data it brings is meaningless without the requirement ('requires').
#
#   - Or because it actually adds other components prior to its own expansion process.
#     TODO: This is actually a property of the *blueprint* and not exactly the component,
#           and this should be clarified in future refactoring of the framework.
#     In this situation, the blueprint either:
#       - Automatically adds them if not already present ('implies').
#       - Automatically adds them but errors if already present ('brings').
#     TODO: unify the above two situations into just 'bringing' with different behaviours?
#
#   - Or because the blueprint just needs the data
#     for its own check/expand! process ('buildsfrom'),
#     but the component data produced after expansion is meaningful even without them.
#
# Components also 'conflict' with each other:
#
#   - It is a failure to add a component if it conflicts
#     with another component already added.
#
#   - An abstract component type cannot conflict with a component subtyping itself.
#
# Component types can be structured with a julia abstract type hierarchy:
#
#   - Requiring an abstract component A
#     is requiring that any component subtyping A be present.
#
#   - Implying / Bringing / Building-from an abstract component A
#     is implying or bringing or building-from some component subtyping A
#     but it is unspecified which one.
#
#   - Conflicting with an abstract component A
#     is conflicting with any component subtyping A.
#
# It is not currently possible for an abstract component
# to 'require', 'imply', 'bring', 'buildfrom', 'check' or 'expand!'.
# But this might be implemented for a convincingly motivated need,
# at the cost of extending @component macro to accept abstract types.
#
# The parametric type 'V' for the component/blueprint
# is the type of the value wrapped by the system.

## Components require each other or conflict with each other.
## Blueprints bring each other or imply components.
## Blueprints are trees of sub-blueprints and must be treated as such.
##
## The add! procedure requires that:
##   - the given blueprint be visited as a tree to collect:
##     - all brought sub-blueprints
##     - the possibly implied blueprints indexed by their component
##       and associated with the set of sub-blueprints possibly implying them.
##   - Check that all requirements *will* be met and that no conflict *will* be found.
##   - for all components implied but not brought,
##     construct implied blueprints from the first matching sub-blueprint.
##   - expand/add all sub-blueprints in correct order.
##   - eventuall expand/add the root blueprint.
##
## Exposing the first analysis step of the above will be useful to implement default_model.
## The default model handles a *forest* of blueprints, and needs to possibly *move* nodes
## from later blueprints to earlier blueprints so as to make the inference intuitive and
## consistent.
## Maybe this can even be implemented within the framework itself, something along:
##    add_default!(
##        forest::Blueprints;
##        without = Component[],
##        defaults = OrderedDict{Component,Function{<SomeState> ↦ Blueprint}}(),
##        state_control! = Function{new_brought/implied_blueprint ↦ edit_state},
##    )
